## 🧠 Overview

This repository implements a simulation and modeling framework for **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)**-assisted IoT networks operating under **time-varying wireless channels**.  
It aims to study and mitigate signal degradation in limited feedback conditions by leveraging optimized configurations and learning-based models.

This work is an extension of our team ongoing research on **RIS-assisted 6G IoT networks** and corresponds to the findings discussed in the paper:

> 📄 [Attention-Guided Encoder-Decoder Design for Efficient RIS Phase Configuration in Time-Varying IoT Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11168457)  
> _IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, 2025._

## 🚀 Features

- Simulation of **time-varying RIS-assisted IoT networks**
- Configurable **feedback bandwidth constraints**
- Support for **autoencoder-based encoding/decoding** of RIS control bits
- Modular pipeline for:
  - Dataset generation
  - Model training & evaluation
- Integration-ready design for **6G/IoT simulation experiments**
